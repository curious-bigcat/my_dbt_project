# dbt Snowflake Data Pipeline

This repository contains a dbt project that implements a complete data pipeline on Snowflake using the Jaffle Shop and Stripe datasets. The project follows a layered architecture to transform raw data into clean, business-ready models.

## Overview

This pipeline is structured into three logical layers:

1. **Raw**: Mirrors the Snowflake `RAW` database tables directly.
2. **Curated**: Performs cleaning, deduplication, and standardization of raw data.
3. **Presentation**: Provides business-level aggregations, metrics, and segmentation.

Data is initially loaded into Snowflake from public S3 buckets. dbt then processes the data through each layer, producing insights that can be consumed by analytics or BI tools.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Snowflake account (with access to a warehouse, role, and schema)
- dbt installed via pip:

```bash
pip install dbt-snowflake
```

- Raw data preloaded into Snowflake:
  - `RAW.JAFFLE_SHOP.CUSTOMERS`
  - `RAW.JAFFLE_SHOP.ORDERS`
  - `RAW.STRIPE.PAYMENT`

---

## Initial Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curious-bigcat/my_dbt_project.git
cd my_dbt_project
```

### 2. Configure dbt Profile

Create or edit your `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` file:

```yaml
snowflakebs:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: <your_account_identifier>
      user: <your_username>
      password: <your_password>
      role: <your_role>
      warehouse: transforming
      database: analytics
      schema: public
      threads: 4
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual Snowflake credentials and environment details.

---

## Running the Pipeline

### 1. Test the dbt Connection

```bash
dbt debug
```

This checks that your profile and Snowflake access are configured correctly.

### 2. Build All Models

```bash
dbt build
```

This command executes all dbt models (raw, curated, presentation) in dependency order, and runs any associated tests.

### 3. Generate and View Documentation

```bash
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the interactive documentation and model lineage graph.

## Model Layer Details

### Raw Layer

- `raw_customers.sql`: Selects all columns from `RAW.JAFFLE_SHOP.CUSTOMERS`
- `raw_orders.sql`: Selects all columns from `RAW.JAFFLE_SHOP.ORDERS`
- `raw_payments.sql`: Selects all columns from `RAW.STRIPE.PAYMENT`

These models are materialized as views in the `analytics.raw` schema.

### Curated Layer

- Cleans data (e.g., `initcap` on names)
- Deduplicates records using `row_number() over (...)` based on load timestamps
- Extracts `year` and `month` fields for temporal reporting

Models include:
- `stg_customers`
- `stg_orders`
- `stg_payments`

### Presentation Layer

Models perform business-level aggregations and segmentation, including:

- `customer_order_summary`: Joins orders and payments by customer
- `rfm_segmentation`: Classifies customers into RFM segments
- `rolling_7day_revenue`: Computes 7-day rolling revenue totals
- `anomalous_payments`: Detects outlier payments using statistical thresholds
- `first_vs_repeat_orders`: Analyzes behavior of new vs returning customers

---

## Common Queries

To explore your presentation layer models, use queries like:

```sql
-- Top 10 customers by revenue
SELECT * 
FROM analytics.presentation.customer_order_summary
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- All anomalous payments
SELECT * 
FROM analytics.presentation.anomalous_payments
WHERE anomaly_flag != 'Normal';
```

---

## Recommendations for Production

- Use environment variables or secret management for sensitive credentials
- Add `sources.yml` for formal source definitions and lineage tracking
- Add `schema.yml` files for tests like `not_null`, `unique`, etc.
- Consider using `snapshots` to track slowly changing data
- Deploy via dbt Cloud or CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)

Would you like me to:
- Save and commit this directly to your repo as `README.md`?
- Add a `.gitignore` and basic `schema.yml` with tests?
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated `dbt build`?
